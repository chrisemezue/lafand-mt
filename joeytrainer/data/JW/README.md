You need to put your files inside the `JW` directory.

Two ways I suggest you can do it (feel free to get creative):
1. Follow the Colab tutorial and use the method proposed in the [README](https://github.com/chrisemezue/lafand-mt/tree/general/joeytrainer#readme).
2. Fork this repository, clone it on your PC, save the files directly on the JW folder, push your updates and clone your repository instead of Step 1 in the [Steps](https://github.com/chrisemezue/lafand-mt/tree/general/joeytrainer#steps).
